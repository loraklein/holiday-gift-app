## Design Decisions

The application was designed with user experience and maintainability in mind. Here are some key design decisions:

1. **Component Architecture**: The app uses a modular component structure, separating concerns into reusable UI components, feature-specific components, and layout components. This makes the codebase maintainable and scalable.

2. **API Integration**: I implemented a robust API client using TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety and better developer experience. The API client handles all data fetching, caching, and error states through TanStack Query.

3. **Responsive Design**: Using Tailwind CSS, I've created a fully responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The mobile-first approach ensures a great experience across all devices.
